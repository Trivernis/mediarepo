  Mediarepo is a tool for managing media files. It works similar to image boards
  (boorus) as it allows one to assign tags to media entries and search for entries by using those tags.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
